<h2>What do I submit?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your written up answers to exercise questions. If you work on a piece of paper, please scan using some sort of phone software (like Microsoft Lens or Adobe Scan) rather than just taking a picture. You can also integrate your written answers into your do-file, just be clear about it.</li>
<li>A do-file that runs your Stata analysis (for question 4).</li>
