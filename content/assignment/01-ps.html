<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to Problem Set 1! There are two “problem” exercises and one extended Stata exercise. You’ll need to submit three things on Blackboard: a problem set, log file, <em>and</em> a do-file.</p>
<p>Note that there are superscripted numbers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> throughout the page that provide additional information/suggestions to help you out.</p>

5. Grades on a standardized test are known to have a mean of 1000 for students in the United States. The test is administered to 453 randomly selected students in Florida; in this sample, the mean is 1013 and the standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) is 108.</p>

<p><!-- c. Another 503 students are selected at random from Florida. They are given a 3-hour preparation course before the test is administered Their average test scores is 1019 with a standard deviation of 95.
