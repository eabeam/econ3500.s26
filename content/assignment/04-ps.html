<li>Why might <span class="math inline">\(nox\)</span> [or more precisely, <span class="math inline">\(log(nox)\)</span>] and <span class="math inline">\(rooms\)</span> be negatively correlated? If this is the case, does the simple regression of <span class="math inline">\(log(price)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(log(nox)\)</span> produce an upward or a downward biased estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>?</li>

<!-- Consider the one-variable regression model $Y_i = \beta_0 = \beta_1 x_i + u_i$ and suppose it satisfies the least squares assumptions in Key Concept 4.3. Suppose $Y_i$ is measured with error, so the data are $\widetilde{Y_i} = Y_i + w_i$, where $w_i$ is the measurement error, which is i.i.d. and independent of $Y_i$ and $X_i$. Consider the population regression $Y$ using the mismeasured dependent variable, $\widetilde{Y}$. -->

<!--   b. Show that the regression $\widetilde{Y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + v_i$ satisfies the least squares assumptions in Key Concept 4.3. Assume that $w_i$ is independent of $Y_j$ and $X_j$ for all values of $i$ and $j$ and has a finite fourth moment. -->

<li>Labor economists studying the determinants of women’s earnings discovered a puzzling empirical result. Using randomly selected employed women, they regressed earnings on the women’s number of children and a set of control variables (age, education, occupation, and so forth). They found that women with more children had higher wages, controlling for these other factors. Explain how sample selection might be the cause of this result. (Hint: Notice that women who do not work outside the home are missing from the sample.) [This empirical puzzle motivated James Heckman’s research on sample selection that led to his 2000 Nobel Prize in Economics. See Heckman (1974)]</li>
