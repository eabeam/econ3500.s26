## What should I know? 

Make sure you are comfortable with the material chapter guides from [Week 1](../01-content) and  [Week 2](../02-content). What does comfortable mean? That you're familiar with definitions and terminology, and that you can work through problems at the level of PS1 (solutions on [Brightspace](http://brightspace.uvm.edu)).

There will *not* be a Stata component to the exam. 

## I need more practice!

I recommend the following resources: 

 - Odd-numbered problems from Stock and Watson - solutions are available [here](../../bonus/general-resources)
 - [Practice exam](#practice-exam)
 - [In-class practice](#inclass-practice)

## What is the structure of the exam? 

The exam will be a lot like a math exam - solving some problems and showing your work. I would expect about 3 multi-part questions. There may be some questions that involve definitions and/or true-false.


The exam is closed book with a calculator allowed. You are allowed to bring a one-page formula sheet.

What is allowed?

  - Pen or pencil
  - One page formula sheet (double sided)
  - Calculator (basic, scientific, graphing)
  - Drink and quiet snack
  
What is not allowed?

  - ~~Phone~~ 
  - ~~Other notes~~
  - ~~Textbook~~
  - ~~Tablet/Laptop~~
  - ~~Earbuds/headphones~~



<!-- ### In-class practice  -->

<!-- [Here are the problems](../practice/EC200-03-01practice.pdf) we covered in class. -->


<!-- And a video with solutions! I recommend working through the problems on your own **first**.  -->

<!-- `r htmltools::HTML("{{< youtube q_NbBSDWcpI >}}")` -->

<!-- Or, download a [pdf of the solutions](../practice/EC200-03-01practice_solutions.pdf) -->


## Helpful materials {#helpful-materials}

Two things that may be useful to you: 

- [Standard Normal Distribution Table](../AppendixTable1_rev.pdf)

- [Formula chart](../Formula-sheet_f20.pdf): Is this all the knowledge you need to know? Of course not! But, this should cover most of the formulas you might need. 

## Past exam  {#practice-exam .unnumbered}

Yes, this exam is very old! Fortunately, the statistics don't change!
